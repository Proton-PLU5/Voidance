# Voidance, The Minecraft Server


Welcome to Voidance! This is the offical page for voidances git Repo and Website!
We are a fun Survival Multiplayer community which also happens to be modded!

_Voidance is a modded SMP server, actually, it's more than that, it has a bit of role-play elements in it and lore as well, call it an SMR why not. In voidance, you can make friends, create amazing structures, tame and hunt dragons, etc. We have more biomes to explore, new structures that spawn, and it’s a hard survival experience.

Once we were all about creativity, then we later realized through many things that have gone by, Creativity is just a necessity. During these tough times, people wanted to socialize take part in events, wake up the next morning to see what has happened, and basically a game where everything is fun.

We have a decent player base, Though small in numbers we are strong together. We want to create a server which everyone feels a part off, Thats our non cannon subtitle!

_Our lore is small and humble. When we first made the lore, it heavily ignored and died down, but this time we have a new idea, A idea that will depict the future of Voidance and how it is going to continue, Are you curious? Well, if you continue reading my friend. The lore is about groups, they can be considered much like kingdoms, legions, and organizations, etc. They will have structures, towns, or places where they live and reign. That is just the beginning there’s much more to this tale. Groups can have conflicts with each other which can be classified or understood as ‘wars. During these said wars the groups can attack each other, steal items, use dragons and other means to take down their enemy, In the end, there will be only one winner and one loser. You can make allies or join forces share wealth and much more. If you aren’t interested in fights, you can join a peace group or live separately minding your own business, etc._

We have a small team of moderators and admins who will help you out with any problem!

We have grief prevention, Not by shovels but by groups. The groups also have a claiming system so people can claim land for themselves. We also have block logging so we will find the culprit real fast.
